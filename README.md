# EstiAccess X
Create scaleable, maintainble, remotely managed Minecraft server instances.

EstiAccess X is a remote management UI and daemon manager built for Minecraft Servers running on Linux. Servers can be run as daemons on systemd, and directly interacted with using a client GUI.

## Usage
To start the EAX Server:
```bash
cd EAXServer
npm install # only for first run.
node index.js
```
EAX will load the Minecraft Server (as defined in **spawn.sh**) using a jar given to it (default: PaperSpigot-latest.jar). EAX will set the server's working directory to the "**server**" directory.

EAX Server will listen on port 3000 for the console management, and port 3001 for the file server.

To start the EAX Client:
```bash
cd EAXClient
npm install # only for first run.
electron .
```

**Enjoy!** Remember that EstiAccess X is still in development and things will get better over time.
